# Athletic Detail Page Implementation

## Overview

The Athletic Detail Page has been implemented to provide detailed information about each athletic team, including their schedule and participating modalities.

## Features

### 1. Athletic Information Header
- Athletic logo (with fallback for missing images)
- Athletic nickname (main title)
- Athletic name (subtitle)
- Description (if available)

### 2. Calendar Tab
- **Sub-tabs for competition dates:**
  - **Serie A:** October 31, November 1, November 2, 2025
  - **Serie B:** November 14, 15, 16, 2025
- **Game cards showing:**
  - Modality and phase (Final, Semifinal, Quartas, Oitavas)
  - Game time
  - Venue (if available)
  - Team logos and scores
  - Game status (Scheduled, Live, Finished)

### 3. Modalities Tab
- List of all modalities the athletic participates in
- Modality icons based on sport type
- Status indicators for each modality

## Technical Implementation

### Models Created
1. **AthleticDetail** - Contains detailed athletic information
2. **AthleticGame** - Contains game information with teams and scores
3. **ModalityWithStatus** - Extended modality model with status

### Repository
- **AthleticDetailRepository** - Handles data fetching for:
  - Athletic details
  - Games by date
  - Athletic modalities
  - Series-specific date ranges

### Navigation
- Updated `athletics_page.dart` to navigate to detail page instead of showing snackbar
- Uses `Navigator.push` with `MaterialPageRoute`

## Database Integration

### SQL Functions
A Supabase function `get_athletic_games` has been created to efficiently fetch game data with:
- Bracket position detection for phase determination
- Team information and logos
- Venue details
- Score information

### Fallback Mechanism
The implementation includes multiple fallback layers:
1. Custom RPC function (preferred)
2. Direct table queries with joins
3. Error handling with user-friendly messages

## UI Components

### Game Cards
- Visual representation of matchups
- Color-coded status indicators
- Team logos with error handling
- Score display

### Modality Cards
- Sport-specific icons
- Status indicators
- Clean list layout

### Date Navigation
- Tab-based date selection
- Formatted date display (DD/MM)
- Empty state handling

## Error Handling

- Loading states during data fetch
- Error messages with retry options
- Graceful fallbacks for missing data
- Image error handling with placeholder icons

## Usage

To navigate to an athletic detail page:

```dart
Navigator.of(context).push(
  MaterialPageRoute(
    builder: (context) => AthleticDetailPage(athletic: athleticItem),
  ),
);
```

## Database Setup

To set up the SQL function, run the SQL code in `supabase docs/get_athletic_games_function.sql` in your Supabase SQL editor.

## Future Enhancements

1. Add game detail pages
2. Implement live score updates
3. Add athletic statistics
4. Include social media links
5. Add photo galleries
6. Implement push notifications for game updates
